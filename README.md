# bd_first_project
Big Data course' projects of the University of RomaTre.

The aim of the project is to design and implement 3 different jobs, each in MapReduce, Hive and Spark, comparing these three systems on each of them. The comparison is based on the analysis of job execution times both locally and on clusters, on the basis of variable input dimensions.
